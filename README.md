# Sales-Performance (2023 vs 2024)
## 📈 Sales Performance Insights: 2023 vs 2024  
“Tools don’t tell stories. People do.”

Hi, I’m Adeniran Kehinde, a junior-level data practitioner rediscovering the power of storytelling with Excel. After half a decade of living in Power BI, I recently returned to build a comprehensive sales performance dashboard in traditional Microsoft Excel. This project was more than just a spreadsheet; it represented a comeback that was savored with patience while I attempted to reconnect with how things were done in Excel, since it had been a while since I was here. I built this sales performance report from scratch using nothing but formulas, curiosity, and a deep desire to turn numbers into narrative.

My goal? To compare how our sales performed in 2023 versus 2024 and uncover what the data was really saying.

## 🔍 What I Discovered
- Sales jumped by 30% to $475.6K, with profit rising 34% — a clear sign of growth.
- Monthly revenue trends showed consistent performance across 2024, not just isolated spikes.
- Regional breakdowns revealed strong sales in the South and West, but untapped potential in the North.
- Product analysis highlighted top performers like headphones and monitors, while laptops and printers lagged.
- Biggest orders gave clues about high-value customers and future targeting strategies.

## 💡 Why I Built This?
In as much as organizations want to be able to track KPIs quickly, this wasn’t entirely just about KPIs; it was about clarity. I wanted stakeholders to see the story behind the numbers: where we’re winning, where we’re lagging, and where we can grow. Excel gave me full control to shape the visuals, craft the narrative, and connect the dots in a way that’s clear, honest, and actionable.

If you’re an analyst, a manager, or just someone who loves data with heart — I hope this dashboard speaks to you. 

**_PS: I am always open to collaborating to help push the boundaries of what's possible with data._**
